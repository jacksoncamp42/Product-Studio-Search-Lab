Text: You can receive home health care coverage under either MedicarePart A or Part B. Under Part B, you are eligible for home health care if you are homebound and need skilled care. There is no prior hospital stay requirement for Part B coverage of home health care. There is also no deductible or coinsurance for Part B-covered home health care.
While home health care is normally covered by Part B, Part A provides coverage in certain circumstances after you are in a hospital or skilled nursing facility (SNF). Specifically, if you spend at least three consecutive days as a hospital inpatient or have a Medicare-covered SNF stay, Part A covers your first 100 days of home health care. You still must meet other home health care eligibility requirements, such as being homebound and needing skilled care. You also must receive home health services within 14 days of your hospital or SNF discharge to be covered under Part A. Any additional days past 100 are covered by Part B. Regardless of whether your care is covered by Part A or Part B, Medicare pays the full cost.

Response: To qualify for home health care under Medicare, there are specific requirements that need to be met. Here are the general criteria for eligibility:

1. **Medicare Coverage**: You must be enrolled in Medicare Part A and/or Part B to receive home health services. Original Medicare (Part A and Part B) covers home health care services if you meet the qualifying conditions.

2. **Doctor's Certification**: A doctor must certify that you need intermittent skilled nursing care, physical therapy, speech-language pathology services, or continue receiving occupational therapy. The doctor must also certify that you are homebound, meaning it is difficult for you to leave your home without assistance.

3. **Care Plan**: Your doctor must create a care plan that is regularly reviewed and updated as needed. The care plan should outline the services you need, how often you need them, and the expected outcomes.

4. **Home Health Agency**: You must use a Medicare-certified home health agency that provides skilled nursing care, therapy services, or home health aide services. These agencies must meet specific Medicare requirements to deliver covered services.

5. **Intermittent Care**: Home health care services are typically provided on an intermittent basis. This means they are needed for a short period of time and not on a continuous, daily basis.

6. **Homebound Status**: To be considered homebound, you must have a condition that makes leaving your home difficult without considerable effort. This could be due to illness, injury, or other reasons that limit your ability to leave your home.

7. **Skilled Care Needs**: You must require skilled care services such as wound dressing changes, injections, physical therapy, or other services that can only be provided by healthcare professionals.

By meeting these requirements, individuals can qualify for home health care services under Medicare. It's essential to work with your healthcare provider and a Medicare-certified home health agency to ensure that you meet the necessary criteria and receive the care you need in the comfort of your home.
