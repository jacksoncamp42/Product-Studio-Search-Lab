Text: The Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine, led by the esteemed Louis J. Aronne, MD, stands as a beacon of excellence in the field of obesity evaluation and treatment. Under the direction of Professor Aronne, a renowned figure in Clinical Medicine and Metabolic Research, our Center adopts a multidisciplinary approach focused on evidence-based, compassionate care for patients grappling with obesity.

Dedicated to advancing knowledge in the realms of obesity and type 2 diabetes, our Center not only offers clinical care but also spearheads cutting-edge research initiatives and imparts valuable training to physicians and aspiring students in the domain of obesity medicine.

At the heart of our approach lies a profound understanding that obesity is a complex interplay of multifaceted factors, often leading to a myriad of health complications such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and arthritis. Through meticulous personal assessments, our team diligently identifies the root causes of weight-related issues, tailoring solutions that range from addressing medication-induced weight gain to managing sleep disorders that may contribute to excessive weight.

Our team, comprising board-certified physicians from diverse backgrounds, alongside registered dietitians and a family nurse practitioner/diabetes educator, collaborates synergistically to empower our patients in achieving and sustaining weight loss through a spectrum of interventions spanning lifestyle modifications, pharmaceutical approaches, and surgical interventions where necessary.

Embracing a patient-centric ethos, we engage in shared decision-making to craft personalized treatment plans that align with the unique needs and goals of each individual. As the journey unfolds, we remain steadfast in our commitment to closely monitoring progress, adjusting strategies as required, and providing continuous support through in-person consultations and cutting-edge technologies like remote patient monitoring.

Your inaugural visit to our Center signifies the commencement of a transformative partnership geared towards your well-being. We pride ourselves on delivering unparalleled medical care that not only targets the underlying health issues but also ensures a seamless, stress-free experience for every patient.

To facilitate a seamless consultation process, we kindly request arriving at least 15 minutes prior to your appointment time. Punctuality is paramount, and in the event of delays exceeding 15 minutes, we may need to reschedule your visit to ensure optimal time management and care for all patients.

For a smooth experience, please ensure to complete the Health History Form accurately, detailing all medications, supplements, and relevant medical information. Additionally, if an electrocardiogram is warranted (if not conducted within the last two years), it will be undertaken during your visit.

In valuing your time and the needs of fellow patients, we encourage prompt notification in the case of cancellations or rescheduling. By adhering to the 24-hour advance notice policy for appointment adjustments, you contribute to the efficient functioning of our Center, enabling us to accommodate all patients effectively.
