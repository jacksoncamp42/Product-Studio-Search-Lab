Text: In order to receive home health care coverage, there are two primary avenues through which you can be eligible: MedicarePart A or Part B. For those who qualify under Part B, the criteria are clear-cut - if you are homebound and require skilled care, you are entitled to home health care benefits. Notably, there are no prerequisites such as a prior hospital stay for Part B coverage, and there are no deductibles or coinsurance fees associated with Part B-covered home health care.

While Part B is the typical avenue for home health care coverage, it is essential to recognize the role of Part A in specific situations, particularly post-hospitalization or during a stay in a skilled nursing facility (SNF). Following a minimum of three consecutive days as a hospital inpatient or as part of a Medicare-covered SNF stay, Part A steps in to cover the initial 100 days of home health care. Naturally, meeting additional eligibility standards applies here, encompassing the requirement of being homebound, necessitating skilled care, and commencing home health services within 14 days post-hospital or SNF discharge to fall under Part A coverage. Any extension beyond the initial 100 days is seamlessly transitioned to Part B coverage. It is imperative to note that irrespective of whether coverage falls under Part A or Part B, Medicare assumptively covers the entire cost, underscoring a comprehensive and equitable support system for recipients.
