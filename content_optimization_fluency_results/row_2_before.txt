Response: Original Medicare is the foundational federal health insurance program in the United States that consists of two main parts: **Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance)** and **Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance)**. 

1. **Medicare Part A**: 
   - [Medicare Part A](https://www.medicareinteractive.org/get-answers/medicare-basics/medicare-coverage-overview/original-medicare) covers inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing facility care, hospice care, and some home health care services. Most individuals do not pay a premium for Part A if they or their spouse paid Medicare taxes while working.

2. **Medicare Part B**: 
   - [Medicare Part B](https://www.medicareinteractive.org/get-answers/medicare-basics/medicare-coverage-overview/original-medicare) covers services like doctor visits, outpatient care, preventive services, and some home health care services. Part B requires a monthly premium, with costs that can vary based on income.

Original Medicare involves direct payment by the government for the healthcare services received. Individuals enrolled in Original Medicare are responsible for cost-sharing elements like premiums, deductibles, and coinsurances. They can also opt for a Medigap policy to help reduce out-of-pocket costs. It's important to note that Original Medicare does not include prescription drug coverage (Part D), which individuals may need to sign up for separately through private companies.

Moreover, individuals enrolled in Original Medicare have the option to consider a switch to a Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C) through private insurance companies approved by Medicare, but there are specific enrollment periods for making such changes.

Understanding the components and coverage of Original Medicare is crucial for making informed decisions about healthcare coverage, ensuring access to necessary medical services and support.
