1. **Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance)**:
   - [Medicare Part A](https://www.medicareinteractive.org/get-answers/medicare-basics/medicare-coverage-overview/original-medicare) covers inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing facility care, hospice care, and some home health care services.

3. **Medicare Part C (Medicare Advantage)**:
   - [Medicare Part C](https://www.medicareinteractive.org/get-answers/medicare-basics/medicare-coverage-overview/original-medicare) is an alternative way to receive Medicare benefits through private insurance companies approved by Medicare. These plans typically include coverage for Parts A and B and often additional benefits like dental, vision, and prescription drug coverage.

4. **Medicare Part D (Prescription Drug Coverage)**:
   - [Medicare Part D](https://www.medicareinteractive.org/get-answers/medicare-basics/medicare-coverage-overview/original-medicare) is a standalone prescription drug coverage that can be added to Original Medicare, some Medicare Cost Plans, and Medicare Private Fee-for-Service plans.

These parts together make up the foundation of Medicare coverage, providing a range of healthcare services and options for eligible individuals. Understanding the parts of Medicare can help individuals make informed decisions about their healthcare coverage.
