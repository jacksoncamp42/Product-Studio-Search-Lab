2. **Homebound Criteria**: You must meet the homebound criteria, which means that leaving home requires a considerable effort, assistance, or poses a risk to your health.

3. **Skilled Services Requirement**: You should require intermittent skilled nursing care, physical therapy, speech-language pathology services, or continuing occupational therapy.

4. **Enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B**: To receive home health services, you must be enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B.

5. **Receive Care from a Medicare-Certified Agency**: The home health agency providing your care must be certified by Medicare.
