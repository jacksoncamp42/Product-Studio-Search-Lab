Response: Qualifying for home health care under Medicare involves meeting specific criteria set by Medicare. To qualify for home health care benefits, you must:

1. **Be Under a Physician's Care**: Your doctor must establish and periodically review a plan of care for you.

2. **Meet Homebound Criteria**: You must be homebound, meaning leaving home is a considerable effort, requiring assistance, or a risk to your health.

3. **Require Skilled Services**: You need intermittent skilled nursing care, physical therapy, speech-language pathology services, or continuing occupational therapy.

4. **Be Enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B**: To receive home health services, you must be enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B.

5. **Receive Care from a Medicare-Certified Agency**: The home health agency providing your care must be Medicare-certified.

6. **Have a Care Plan**: You must have a care plan established and reviewed by a doctor.

If you meet these criteria, Medicare may cover services like part-time skilled nursing care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology services, medical social services, durable medical equipment, and other services.
