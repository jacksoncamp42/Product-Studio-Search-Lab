Response_After: The "coverage gap" refers to a phase in Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage where beneficiaries may experience a gap in coverage for their medications. This gap occurs after the initial coverage period when the total drug costs, including what the individual and the plan have paid for drugs, reach a certain limit. In 2024, this limit is set at $5,030.

Historically, while in the coverage gap, beneficiaries were responsible for a higher percentage of the cost of their drugs. However, as of 2020, the coverage gap, commonly known as the "donut hole," has closed for all drugs. This means that individuals who enter this phase are now responsible for paying 25% of the cost of their drugs. This change has made drug costs more predictable and reduced the financial burden on beneficiaries during the coverage gap.

Even though the donut hole has closed, beneficiaries may still notice a difference in costs between the initial coverage period and this phase. For example, if a drug's total cost is $100 and the beneficiary paid a $20 copay during the initial coverage period, in the coverage gap, they would be responsible for paying $25 (25% of $100).
