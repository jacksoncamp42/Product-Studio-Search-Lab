Response: Medicare does cover certain types of care at home, specifically home health care services. Home health care under Medicare includes a range of medical services provided in the home for beneficiaries who meet specific criteria. These services are typically provided by a home health agency and may include skilled nursing care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology services, medical social services, durable medical equipment, and other services.

To qualify for Medicare-covered home health care, beneficiaries must meet certain requirements such as being under a physician's care, meeting homebound criteria, requiring skilled services, being enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B, receiving care from a Medicare-certified agency, and having a care plan established by a doctor. The care provided must be intermittent and medically necessary.

It's important to note that Medicare does not cover custodial care or long-term care services provided in the home, such as assistance with activities of daily living (e.g., bathing, dressing, eating) or homemaker services.
